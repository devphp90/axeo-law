<h1>Software for Managing Your Law Practice</h1>

<h3>cases, matters, calendaring...</h3>
<p>~ <strong>Law is cloud-based</strong>.&nbsp; Designed and built from the 
    ground-up for the cloud using the latest Open Source platform, tools, and 
    techniques. No infrastructure to install, maintain, and secure  
    lowering Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). The software and data reside in a Tier-1 
    datacenter connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>~ <strong>Law is browser-based</strong>.&nbsp; Accessible from any 
    device such as a PC, Mac, smartphone, or tablet that can run a browser (IE, Chrome, Safari, 
    etc.).&nbsp; No software to install or upgrade lowering TCO and increasing 
    flexibility.</p>
<p>~ <strong>Law is multi-portal</strong>.&nbsp; Not just the typical User and Admin, but Clients and other 3rd Parties.</p>
<p>~ <strong>Law is fast</strong>. A cloud app, but comparable to, or even faster than 
    in office, client-server systems.</p>
<p>~ <strong>Law provides a modern UI/UX</strong>, in a cloud based app.&nbsp; 
    The same features users 
    have long enjoyed on desktop computers with Windows and MacOS.</p>
<p>~ <strong>Law is built with security</strong> as a main concern, and includes options such as Multi Factor Authentication 
    (MFA).</p>
